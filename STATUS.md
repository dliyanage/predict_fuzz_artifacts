# Artifacts for the Paper, "Extrapolating Coverage Rate in Greybox Fuzzing".

We kindly request the ICSE'24 artifact evaluation committee to consider our artifact as:
- **available and reusable.**

We make available:
- All the `scripts` and `data` to reproduce the results presented in the paper.
- Pre-validated `instructions` to reproduce the results by running the Jupyter workbooks locally.
  (The instructions include machine, environment, and library requirements)
- Instructions to replace the experimental data files for any other greybox fuzzing campaign and generate the same set of outputs for new data.
